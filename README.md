# DAX-Daily-Volatility-Time-spent-Vs.-52-Week-Range
DAX Daily Volatility &amp; Time spent Vs. 52-Week Range (research)

In this Python script I took 31 years of German Dax market data, calculated at each day the relative location of the closing price vs it's one year (252 trading days) range and the daily True Range (high+low+gap's) normalized with percentage. Additionally, I wanted to check the time spent and daily volatility at each segment, the results are similar in every market and emphasis market characteristic of spending most of the time in the upper 52 week range (up bias), and more volatile at lower relative segments.
